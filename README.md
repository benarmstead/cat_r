# cat_r

An implementation of cat, written in Rust, and done recursively.

I made this program due to a need to recursively cat through a directory, and its subdirectories.
cat_r is an extreamly quick way to do this, as it is written in rust and highly effecient.

## Compiling from source

`git clone https://github.com/benarmstead/cat_r.git`

`cd cat_r`

`cargo build --release`

### Running

`./target/release/cat_r <directory to cat_r here>`
